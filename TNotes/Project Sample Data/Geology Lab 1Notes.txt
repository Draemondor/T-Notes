Physical Properties

A mineral is naturally occurring, homogenous, solid inorganic substance.
Composed of a single element "or" combination of elements. 
- Most are combinations.

*Minerals are characterized by:
- Specific internal structure which is determined by an arrangement of atoms.
- Chemical Composition
- Physical Properties

*Physical Properties* 
*Mechannial Properties* Properties that represent a minerals response to some sort of applied force.
*Hardness - its resistance to abrasion or scratching. Scratching one mineral with another gives the relative hardness of both minerals.
-Moh's Hardness Scale
*Tenacity - Is a minerals toughness.
- How difficult is it to break into pieces? To Bend? *This is different from hardness
Please not, we don't use the tenacity method in lab because it destroys the sample.

>Brittle - Breaks or powders easily			Glass/Quartz
>Malleable - Can be flattened into thin sheets		Gold/Copper
>Sectile - Can cut grooves into the mineral		Gold/Copper
>Ductile - Can be stretched with outbreaking		Gold/Copper
>Flexible - Stays bent after bending			Chlorite/Copper
>Elastic - Goes back to original shape after bending	Mica/Muscovite - highly elastic

*Cleavage - A break that occurs in specific directions along planar surfaces.
The planar surfaces are parallel to directions of weak bonding in the atomic arrangement of the crystal.
>cubic/Octahedral/dodecahedral/rhombohedral/prismatic/basal

*Fracture - A break that occurs in relatively random directions. Occures in minerals where the chemical bonding is of approximately equal strength in all directions and
where there are not planes of weaker bonds.
*Types of Fractures*
>Conchoidal - Curved broken surfaces - such as glass
>Fibrous or Splintery - Such as frayed Rope or Slivered Wood
>Hackly - Jagged, sharp edged such as torn metal
>Irregular or Uneven - Rough surface such as broken concrete

*Optical Properties - How light interacts with the mineral
Interactions include:
			Absorption
			Transmission
			Reflection

*Color - 1st property to be noted is caused by the absorption of certain wavelengths of light caused by particular
atoms in a mineral.  
	Color is a characteristic
	The atomic arrangement
	Small amounts of impurities
	Structural defects  
Please note: Color is not a reliable identification method for minerals*

*Streak - The color of the powdered mineral - This is more reliable than color.  Streak is usually constant.

*Diaphaneity - Refers to the way in which light is transmitted through a mineral.
>Tansparent - If an image can be seen through a mineral
>Translucent - If an image CAN NOT be seen through a mineral

*An opaque mineral does not allow light to pass through it

*Luster - The way in which a mineral reflects light.
There are 2 major Divisions - Metallic & Non-metallic

>Metallic - Reflect the most light and are opaque.
>No-metallic - Have a range of reflectivity and are transparent to translucent.

>Adamantine - Brilliant play of colors			Diamonds/Shpalerite
>Resinous - Luster of Resin				Garnets/Sulfur
>Vitreous - Luster like glass				Quartz
>Pearly - Irradescent shiny luster			Talc
>Silky - Shiny & Fiberous				Serpentine/Some Gypsum
>Greasy - As if coated thinly with oil			Nepheline
>Earthy - Dull & Powdery				Kaolin/Bauxite

*Luminescence - The ability of a mineral to emit light when ground of struck, heated, or excited by ultraviolet light.
*Other Properties*
>Taste - Only possible for H2O Soluble minerals
>Magnetism - Fundamental property of the mineral due to unpaired electrons on certain atoms
>Specific Gravity - The ratio of its density to that of H2O
>Solubility in Acid - Some minerals are soluble in acid w/hydrochloric acid the acid reacts with carbonates
