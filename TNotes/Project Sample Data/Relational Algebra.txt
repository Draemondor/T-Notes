Relational Algebra Notes

Relational Algebra is a procedural language which takes instances of relations as input
and yeilds occurences of relations as ouput.  RA is performed recursively on a relation
and immediate results are also considered relations.
*RA uses operators to perform queries, wither unary or binary

Fundamental Operations of RA are:

Selection - Selection Operation (looks like a small italic 6) 
>Selects tuples that satisfy the given predicate from a relation

Projection - Project Operation (pi)
>Project columns that satisfy a given predicate
Produces from a relation(R) a new relation containing only some of R's columns and discrads the other 
columns as duplicates are eliminated

Union - Merge - Union (U)
RA: R U S
>Performs binary union between two given relations aka merge
The Union of two relations R & S is the set of tuples that are in R or in S or in both
R & S must have identical sets of attributes and the types of the attributes must be the same
Must occur in the same order
Duplicates elmininated

Intersection - Where both intersect (U turned upside down):)
Defines a relation consisting of a set of all tuples that are in both A and B 

Set Difference (-) 
RA: R - S
>The difference of two relations R & S is the set of tuples that are in R but NOT in S ie. left over in R
Must have same conditions set as in union - see above notes


Cartesian Product aka Cross Product (x)
RA: R x S 
>Two relations R & S is a set of pairs that can be formed by pairing each tuple R with each tuple S 

Theta Join aka Natural Join (infinity or two triangles like a bow tie):)
RA: R infinity S
         c 

Two relations R & S is the set of tuples in the Cartesian product of R & S that satisfy some condition C

Rename - AS() IF two relations have the same attribute, diambiguate the attributes by prefixing the attribute
with the name of the relation it belongs to.
