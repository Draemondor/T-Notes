Net Distance = Integral from a to b v(t) dt

Total Distance = Integral from a to b |v(t) dt
 
Area between two curves using a definite integral

Area = Integral from a to b (Top-Bottom) dx
Area = Integral from a to b (Right - Left) dy

Volume of a solid obtained by rotating a region bounded between
two curves around the x-axis:

Vertical Slice - Disk/Washer
Volume = Integral from a to b pi(Top)^2 - pi(Bottom)^2 dx

Horizontal Slice - Shells
Volume = Integral from a to b 2piy(Right - Left) dy

Volume of a solid obtained by rotating a region bounded between 
two curves around the y-axis:

Vertical Slice - Shells
Volume = Integral from a to b 2pix(Top)- 2pix(Bottom) dx

Horizontal Slice - Disk/Washer
Volume = Integral from a to b pi(Right)^2 - pi(Left)^2 dy
