Geology 

*Earth Structure*

Seismic Waves - The seismic wave velocity changes with composition
Body waves - Pass through Earth's interior
Two Types:
>P-Waves - Travel across land and water - topical	
>S-Waves aka Shear Waves - Can't go through our core as they DO NOT travel through liquid or gases

*The Core - Iron rich sphere with Radius of 3,471km
Has 2 components with differing seismic wave behavior - Iron alloy & Solid Nickel
Inner Core - Radius of 1,220 km
	     Density - 13g/cm^3
	     Solid Nickel
Outer Core - Liquid Iron, Nickel & Sulfur
	     2,255km thick
	     Density - 10-12g/cm^3

Flow in - S-Wave Velocity = 0 km/s
*The outer core generates the magnetic field

*Mantle - Layer above the outer core.  The 
***The mantle is 82% of the Earth's volume***
It is 2,885km thick

Soid rock layer between the crust and core.  
Mantle Composition - Is ultramafic rock peridotite
Ultramafic - Silica poor
Below~100-150km the rock is hot enough to flow

It convects - hot mantle rises
	      cold matter sinks

Flows at rates up to -15cm/yr = 150km/my (million years)
Density 3.5-5.5g/cm^3
Seismic discontinuities - 400km to 410km - Upper Mantle
			  600km to 670km - Lower Mantle

Convection - Hot material rises
Circulation or movement of the heated and cooled parts of rock, gas, ect....

*The Crust - The thickest under Mt. Ranges(25-50km)
	     Thinnest under mid-ocean ridges(5-7km)

The Mohorovicic Discontinuity is the lower boundary that seperates the crust from the mantle.
-Base of the crust has a velocity of about 6km/s
-Top Mantle has a velocity of about 8km/s
>As a result, the refracted(head) P-Wave arrives before the direct P-Wave this also works for the refracted and direct S-Waves.

There are two types of crust:
*Continental Crust - makes up the continents & shelves - less dense
*Oceanic Crust - Underlies the ocean basins

*Crustal Composition - 98.5% of the crust is comprised of just a handfule of elements
Oxygen-30%, Silicon-26%, Fe-35%, Mg-13%
