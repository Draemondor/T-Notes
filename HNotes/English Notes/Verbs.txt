A verb is a part of speech that expresses action or state of being, or connects a subject to a complement. Verbs indicate whether the subject performs an action (active voice) or receives the action (passive voice). Verbs can be transitive (requires a direct object) or intransitive (does not require an object). The tenses of verbs are formed according to person, number, and tense. 

Verbs can have moods, which indicate the attitude of the speaker. Some writers have problems with verbs as the result of an incorrect tense or irregular verbs. Verbs play a key role in constructing sentences.
