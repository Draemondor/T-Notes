A preposition shows the relationship between a noun or pronoun and another noun or pronoun. In the following examples, the italicized words are prepositions and the underlined words are objects of the prepositions.

The cat under the fence 
The cat between the fence and the house 
Everyone except the girl in the blue dress 
A letter about us 
When the object is a pronoun, remember that the pronoun should be in the objective case.

Confusing use of prepositions
The unnecessary use of prepositions is a common error. Be careful not to use a preposition where it isn't needed.

Where have you been?
not Where have you been at? 
Where is Nick going?
not Where is Nick going to? 
Also, don't use two prepositions when you need only one.

Don't go near the water. 
not Don't go near to the water. 
The book fell off the table. 
not The book fell off of the table. 
Ending a sentence with a preposition can cause problems. The rule that a sentence should never end with a preposition is no longer strictly enforced. Still, many writers avoid ending sentences with prepositions. If you feel ending with a preposition makes a sentence sound more natural, do so and don't worry about it.

It is a comment to which I will not respond. 
compared to It is a comment I will not respond to. 
with which to write. 
compared to I bought a pen to write with.
