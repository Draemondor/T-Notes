2.1 Axioms of quantum mechanics
For a few lectures I have been talking about quantum this and that, but I have never de?ned what quantum theory is. It is time to correct that omission. Quantum theory is a mathematical model of the physical world. To characterize the model, we need to specify how it will represent: states, observables, measurements, dynamics.
1. States. A state is a complete description of a physical system. In quantum mechanics, a state is a ray in a Hilbert space.
What is a Hilbert space? a) It is a vector space over the complex numbers C. Vectors will be denoted |?i (Dirac’s ket notation). b) It has an inner product h?|?i that maps an ordered pair of vectors to C, de?ned by the properties (i) Positivity: h?|?i> 0 for |?i = 0 (ii) Linearity: h?|(a|?1i+ b|?2i) = ah?|?1i+ bh?|?2i (iii) Skew symmetry: h?|?i = h?|?i? c) It is complete in the norm ||?||= h?|?i1/2

(Completeness is an important proviso in in?nite-dimensional function spaces, since it will ensure the convergence of certain eigenfunction expansions – e.g., Fourier analysis. But mostly we’ll be content to work with ?nite-dimensional inner product spaces.) What is a ray? It is an equivalence class of vectors that di?er by multiplication by a nonzero complex scalar. We can choose a representative of this class (for any nonvanishing vector) to have unit norm h?|?i = 1. (2.1) We will also say that |?i and ei?|?i describe the same physical state, where |ei?| = 1. (Note that every ray corresponds to a possible state, so that given two states |?i,|?i, we can form another as a|?i + b|?i (the “superposition principle”). The relative phase in this superposition is physically signi?cant; we identify a|?i+ b|?i with ei?(a|?i+ b|?i) but not with a|?i+ ei?b|?i.) 2. Observables. An observable is a property of a physical system that in principle can be measured. In quantum mechanics, an observable is a self-adjoint operator. An operator is a linear map taking vectors to vectors A :|?i?A|?i,A(a|?i+ b|?i) = aA|?i+ bB|?i. (2.2) The adjoint of the operator A is de?ned by h?|A?i = hA†?|?i, (2.3) for all vectors |?i,|?i (where here I have denoted A|?i as |A?i). A is self-adjoint if A = A†. If A and B are self adjoint, then so is A + B (because (A + B)† = A† + B†) but (AB)† = B†A†, so AB is self adjoint only if A and B commute. Note that AB+BA and i(AB?BA) are always self-adjoint if A and B are. A self-adjoint operator in a Hilbert space H has a spectral representation – it’s eigenstates form a complete orthonormal basis inH. We can express a self-adjoint operator A as A =X n anPn. (2.4)
2.1. AXIOMS OF QUANTUM MECHANICS 3
Here each an is an eigenvalue of A, and Pn is the corresponding orthogonal projection onto the space of eigenvectors with eigenvalue an. (If an is nondegenerate, then Pn = |nihn|; it is the projection onto the corresponding eigenvector.) The Pn’s satisfy
PnPm = ?n,mPn P† n = Pn. (2.5)
(For unbounded operators in an in?nite-dimensional space, the de?nition of self-adjoint and the statement of the spectral theorem are more subtle, but this need not concern us.)
3. Measurement. In quantum mechanics, the numerical outcome of a measurement of the observable A is an eigenvalue of A; right after the measurement, the quantum state is an eigenstate of A with the measured eigenvalue. If the quantum state just prior to the measurement is |?i, then the outcome an is obtained with probability Prob (an) =kPn|?ik2= h?|Pn|?i; (2.6) If the outcome is an is attained, then the (normalized) quantum state becomes Pn|?i (h?|Pn|?i)1/2 . (2.7) (Note that if the measurement is immediately repeated, then according to this rule the same outcome is attained again, with probability one.)
4. Dynamics. Time evolution of a quantum state is unitary; it is generated by a self-adjoint operator, called the Hamiltonian of the system. In the Schr¨odinger picture of dynamics, the vector describing the system moves in time as governed by the Schr¨odinger equation
d dt|?(t)i= ?iH|?(t)i, (2.8) where H is the Hamiltonian. We may reexpress this equation, to ?rst order in the in?nitesimal quantity dt, as |?(t + dt)i = (1?iHdt)|?(t)i. (2.9)
4 CHAPTER 2. FOUNDATIONS I: STATES AND ENSEMBLES
The operator U(dt) ? 1? iHdt is unitary; because H is self-adjoint it satis?es U†U = 1 to linear order in dt. Since a product of unitary operators is ?nite, time evolution over a ?nite interval is also unitary
|?(t)i= U(t)|?(0)i. (2.10) In the case where H is t-independent; we may write U = e?itH.
This completes the mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics. We immediately notice some curious features. One oddity is that the Schr¨odinger equation is linear, while we are accustomed to nonlinear dynamical equations in classical physics. This property seems to beg for an explanation. But far more curious is the mysterious dualism; there are two quite distinct ways for a quantum state to change. On the one hand there is unitary evolution, which is deterministic. If we specify |?(0)i, the theory predicts the state |?(t)i at a later time. But on the other hand there is measurement, which is probabilistic. The theory does not make de?nite predictions about the measurement outcomes; it only assigns probabilities to the various alternatives. This is troubling, because it is unclear why the measurement process should be governed by di?erent physical laws than other processes. Beginning students of quantum mechanics, when ?rst exposed to these rules, are often told not to ask “why?” There is much wisdom in this advice. But I believe that it can be useful to ask way. In future lectures. we will return to this disconcerting dualism between unitary evolution and measurement, and will seek a resolution.
2.2 The Qubit
The indivisible unit of classical information is the bit, which takes one of the two possible values {0,1}. The corresponding unit of quantum information is called the “quantum bit” or qubit. It describes a state in the simplest possible quantum system. The smallest nontrivial Hilbert space is two-dimensional. We may denote an orthonormal basis for a two-dimensional vector space as {|0i,|1i}. Then the most general normalized state can be expressed as
a|0i+ b|1i, (2.11)
2.2. THE QUBIT 5
where a,b are complex numbers that satisfy |a|2 +|b|2 = 1, and the overall phase is physically irrelevant. A qubit is a state in a two-dimensional Hilbert space that can take any value of the form eq. (2.11). We can perform a measurement that projects the qubit onto the basis {|0i,|1i}. Then we will obtain the outcome |0i with probability|a|2, and the outcome |1i with probability |b|2. Furthermore, except in the cases a = 0 and b = 0, the measurement irrevocably disturbs the state. If the value of the qubit is initially unknown, then there is no way to determine a and b with that single measurement, or any other conceivable measurement. However, after the measurement, the qubit has been prepared in a known state – either |0i or |1i – that di?ers (in general) from its previous state. In this respect, a qubit di?ers from a classical bit; we can measure a classical bit without disturbing it, and we can decipher all of the information that it encodes. But suppose we have a classical bit that really does have a de?nite value (either 0 or 1), but that value is initially unknown to us. Based on the information available to us we can only say that there is a probability p0 that the bit has the value 0, and a probability p1 that the bit has the value 1, where p0 + p1 = 1. When we measure the bit, we acquire additional information; afterwards we know the value with 100% con?dence. An important question is: what is the essential di?erence between a qubit and a probabilistic classical bit? In fact they are not the same, for several reasons that we will explore.
2.2.1 Spin-1 2 First of all, the coe?cients a and b in eq. (2.11) encode more than just the probabilities of the outcomes of a measurement in the {|0i,|1i} basis. In particular, the relative phase of a and b also has physical signi?cance. For a physicist, it is natural to interpret eq. (2.11) as the spin state of an object with spin-1 2 (like an electron). Then |0i and |1i are the spin up (|?i) and spin down (| ?i) states along a particular axis such as the z-axis. The two real numbers characterizing the qubit (the complex numbers a and b, modulo the normalization and overall phase) describe the orientation of the spin in three-dimensional space (the polar angle ? and the azimuthal angle ?). We cannot go deeply here into the theory of symmetry in quantum mechanics, but we will brie?y recall some elements of the theory that will prove useful to us. A symmetry is a transformation that acts on a state of a system,
6 CHAPTER 2. FOUNDATIONS I: STATES AND ENSEMBLES
yet leaves all observable properties of the system unchanged. In quantum mechanics, observations are measurements of self-adjoint operators. If A is measured in the state |?i, then the outcome |ai (an eigenvector of A) occurs with probability |ha|?i|2. A symmetry should leave these probabilities unchanged (when we “rotate” both the system and the apparatus). A symmetry, then, is a mapping of vectors in Hilbert space |?i?|?0i, (2.12) that preserves the absolute values of inner products |h?|?i|= |h?0|?0i|, (2.13) for all|?iand|?i. According to a famous theorem due to Wigner, a mapping with this property can always be chosen (by adopting suitable phase conventions) to be either unitary or antiunitary. The antiunitary alternative, while important for discrete symmetries, can be excluded for continuous symmetries. Then the symmetry acts as |?i?|?0i = U|?i, (2.14) where U is unitary (and in particular, linear). Symmetries form a group: a symmetry transformation can be inverted, and the product of two symmetries is a symmetry. For each symmetry operation R acting on our physical system, there is a corresponding unitary transformation U(R). Multiplication of these unitary operators must respect the group multiplication law of the symmetries – applying R1?R2 should be equivalent to ?rst applying R2 and subsequently R1. Thus we demand U(R1)U(R2) = Phase (R1,R2)U(R1 ?R2) (2.15) The phase is permitted in eq. (2.15) because quantum states are rays; we need only demand that U(R1 ? R2) act the same way as U(R1)U(R2) on rays, not on vectors. U(R) provides a unitary representation (up to a phase) of the symmetry group. So far, our concept of symmetry has no connection with dynamics. Usually, we demand of a symmetry that it respect the dynamical evolution of the system. This means that it should not matter whether we ?rst transform the system and then evolve it, or ?rst evolve it and then transform it. In other words, the diagram

is commutative. This means that the time evolution operator eitH should commute with the symmetry transformation U(R) :
U(R)e?itH = e?itHU(R), (2.16)
and expanding to linear order in t we obtain
U(R)H = HU(R) (2.17)
For a continuous symmetry, we can choose R in?nitesimally close to the identity, R = I + T, and then U is close to 1, U = 1?i?Q+ O(?2). (2.18) From the unitarity of U (to order ?) it follows that Q is an observable, Q = Q†. Expanding eq. (2.17) to linear order in ? we ?nd
[Q,H] = 0; (2.19)
the observable Q commutes with the Hamiltonian. Eq. (2.19) is a conservation law. It says, for example, that if we prepare an eigenstate of Q, then time evolution governed by the Schr¨odinger equation will preserve the eigenstate. We have seen that symmetries imply conservation laws. Conversely, given a conserved quantity Q satisfying eq. (2.19) we can construct the corresponding symmetry transformations. Finite transformations can be built as a product of many in?nitesimal ones
R = (1 +
? N
T)N ? U(R) = (1 + i
? N
Q)N ? ei?Q, (2.20) (taking the limit N ? ?). Once we have decided how in?nitesimal symmetry transformations are represented by unitary operators, then it is also
8 CHAPTER 2. FOUNDATIONS I: STATES AND ENSEMBLES
determined how ?nite transformations are represented, for these can be built as a product of in?nitesimal transformations. We say that Q is the generator of the symmetry. Let us brie?y recall how this general theory applies to spatial rotations and angular momentum. An in?nitesimal rotation by d? about the axis speci?ed by the unit vector ˆ n = (n1,n2,n3) can be expressed as R(ˆn,d?) = I ?id?ˆ n· ~ J, (2.21) where (J1,J2,J3) are the components of the angular momentum. A ?nite rotation is expressed as R(ˆn,?) = exp(?i?ˆ n· ~ J). (2.22) Rotations about distinct axes don’t commute. From elementary properties of rotations, we ?nd the commutation relations
[Jk,J`] = i?k`mJm, (2.23)
where ?k`m is the totally antisymmetric tensor with ?123 = 1, and repeated indices are summed. To implement rotations on a quantum system, we ?nd self-adjoint operators J1,J2,J3 in Hilbert space that satisfy these relations. The “de?ning” representation of the rotation group is three dimensional, but the simplest nontrivial irreducible representation is two dimensional, given by
Jk =
1 2
?k, (2.24)
where
?1 = 0 1 1 0 !,?2 = 0 ?i i 0 !,?3 = 1 0 0 ?1 !, (2.25) are the Pauli matrices. This is the unique two-dimensional irreducible representation, up to a unitary change of basis. Since the eigenvalues of Jk are ±1 2, we call this the spin-1 2 representation. (By identifying J as the angularmomentum, we have implicitly chosen units with ~ = 1). The Pauli matrices also have the properties of being mutually anticommuting and squaring to the identity,
?k?` + ?`?k = 2?k`1, (2.26)
2.2. THE QUBIT 9
So we see that (ˆ n · ?~)2 = nkn`?k?` = nknk1 = 1. By expanding the exponential series, we see that ?nite rotations are represented as
U(ˆn,?) = e?i? 2
ˆ n·?~ = 1cos ? 2 ?iˆ n·?~ sin
? 2
. (2.27) The most general 2×2 unitary matrix with determinant 1 can be expressed in this form. Thus, we are entitled to think of a qubit as the state of a spin-1 2 object, and an arbitrary unitary transformation acting on the state (aside from a possible rotation of the overall phase) is a rotation of the spin. A peculiar property of the representation U(ˆn,?) is that it is doublevalued. In particular a rotation by 2? about any axis is represented nontrivially: U(ˆn,? = 2?) =?1. (2.28) Our representation of the rotation group is really a representation “up to a sign” U(R1)U(R2) = ±U(R1 ?R2). (2.29) But as already noted, this is acceptable, because the group multiplication is respected on rays, though not on vectors. These double-valued representations of the rotation group are called spinor representations. (The existence of spinors follows from a topological property of the group — it is not simply connected.) While it is true that a rotation by 2? has no detectable e?ect on a spin1 2 object, it would be wrong to conclude that the spinor property has no observable consequences. Suppose I have a machine that acts on a pair of spins. If the ?rst spin is up, it does nothing, but if the ?rst spin is down, it rotates the second spin by 2?. Now let the machine act when the ?rst spin is in a superposition of up and down. Then 1 ?2 (|?i1 +|?i1)|?i2 ? 1 ?2 (|?i1 ?|?i1)|?i2 . (2.30) While there is no detectable e?ect on the second spin, the state of the ?rst has ?ipped to an orthogonal state, which is very much observable. In a rotated frame of reference, a rotation R(ˆn,?) becomes a rotation through the same angle but about a rotated axis. It follows that the three components of angular momentum transform under rotations as a vector: U(R)JkU(R)† = Rk`J`. (2.31)
10 CHAPTER 2. FOUNDATIONS I: STATES AND ENSEMBLES
Thus, if a state |mi is an eigenstate of J3 J3|mi = m|mi, (2.32) then U(R)|mi is an eigenstate of RJ3 with the same eigenvalue: RJ3 (U(R)|mi) = U(R)J3U(R)†U(R)|mi = U(R)J3|mi = m(U(R)|mi). (2.33) Therefore, we can construct eigenstates of angular momentum along the axis ˆ n = (sin? cos?,sin? sin?,cos?) by applying a rotation through ?, about the axis ˆ n0 = (?sin?,cos?,0), to a J3 eigenstate. For our spin-1 2 representation, this rotation is exp"?i? 2 ˆ n0·~?# = exp"? 2 0 ?e?i? ei? 0 !# = cos ? 2 ?e?i? sin ? 2 ei? sin ? 2 cos ? 2 !, (2.34) and applying it to1 0, the J3 eigenstate with eigenvalue 1, we obtain |?(?,?)i= e?i?/2 cos ? 2 ei?/2 sin ? 2 !, (2.35)
(up to an overall phase). We can check directly that this is an eigenstate of
ˆ n·?~ = cos? e?i? sin? ei? sin? ?cos? !, (2.36) with eigenvalue one. So we have seen that eq. (2.11) with a = e?i?/2 cos ? 2,b = ei?/2 sin ? 2, can be interpreted as a spin pointing in the (?,?) direction. We noted that we cannot determine a and b with a single measurement. Furthermore, even with many identical copies of the state, we cannot completely determine the state by measuring each copy only along the z-axis. This would enable us to estimate |a| and |b|, but we would learn nothing about the relative phase of a and b. Equivalently, we would ?nd the component of the spin along the z-axis
h?(?,?)|?3|?(?,?)i= cos2
? 2 ?sin2
? 2
= cos?, (2.37)
2.2. THE QUBIT 11
but we would not learn about the component in the x?y plane. The problem of determining |?i by measuring the spin is equivalent to determining the unit vector ˆ n by measuring its components along various axes. Altogether, measurements along three di?erent axes are required. E.g., from h?3i and h?1i we can determine n3 and n1, but the sign of n2 remains undetermined. Measuring h?2i would remove this remaining ambiguity. Of course, if we are permitted to rotate the spin, then only measurements along the z-axis will su?ce. That is, measuring a spin along the ˆ n axis is equivalent to ?rst applying a rotation that rotates the ˆ n axis to the axis ˆ z, and then measuring along ˆ z. In the special case ? = ? 2 and ? = 0 (the ˆ x-axis) our spin state is
|?xi =
1 ?2 (|?zi+|?zi), (2.38) (“spin-up along the x-axis”). The orthogonal state (“spin down along the x-axis”) is
|?xi =
1 ?2 (|?zi?|?zi). (2.39) For either of these states, if we measure the spin along the z-axis, we will obtain |?zi with probability 1 2 and |?zi with probability 1 2. Now consider the combination 1 ?2 (|?xi+|?xi). (2.40) This state has the property that, if we measure the spin along the x-axis, we obtain |?xi or | ?xi, each with probability 1 2. Now we may ask, what if we measure the state in eq. (2.40) along the z-axis? If these were probabilistic classical bits, the answer would be obvious. The state in eq. (2.40) is in one of two states, and for each of the two, the probability is 1 2 for pointing up or down along the z-axis. So of course we should ?nd up with probability 1 2 when we measure along the z-axis. But not so for qubits! By adding eq. (2.38) and eq. (2.39), we see that the state in eq. (2.40) is really |?zi in disguise. When we measure along the z-axis, we always ?nd |?zi, never |?zi. We see that for qubits, as opposed to probabilistic classical bits, probabilities can add in unexpected ways. This is, in its simplest guise, the phenomenon called “quantum interference,” an important feature of quantum information.
12 CHAPTER 2. FOUNDATIONS I: STATES AND ENSEMBLES
It should be emphasized that, while this formal equivalence with a spin-1 2 object applies to any two-level quantum system, of course not every two-level system transforms as a spinor under rotations!
2.2.2 Photon polarizations
Another important two-state system is provided by a photon, which can have two independent polarizations. These photon polarization states also transform under rotations, but photons di?er from our spin-1 2 objects in two important ways: (1) Photons are massless. (2) Photons have spin-1 (they are not spinors). Now is not a good time for a detailed discussion of the unitary representations of the Poincare group. Su?ce it to say that the spin of a particle classi?es how it transforms under the little group, the subgroup of the Lorentz group that preserves the particle’s momentum. For a massive particle, we may always boost to the particle’s rest frame, and then the little group is the rotation group. For massless particles, there is no rest frame. The ?nite-dimensional unitary representations of the little group turn out to be representations of the rotation group in two dimensions, the rotations about the axis determined by the momentum. Of course, for a photon, this corresponds to the familiar property of classical light – the waves are polarized transverse to the direction of propagation. Under a rotation about the axis of propagation, the two linear polarization states (|xi and |yi for horizontal and vertical polarization) transform as |xi ? cos?|xi+ sin?|yi |yi ? ?sin?|xi+ cos?|yi. (2.41) This two-dimensional representation is actually reducible. The matrix cos? sin? ?sin? cos?! (2.42) has the eigenstates
|Ri =
1 ?2 1 i! |Li = 1 ?2 i 1!, (2.43)
2.3. THE DENSITY MATRIX 13
with eigenvalues ei? and e?i?, the states of right and left circular polarization. That is, these are the eigenstates of the rotation generator J = 0 ?i i 0!= ?y, (2.44) with eigenvalues ±1. Because the eigenvalues are ±1 (not ±1 2) we say that the photon has spin-1. In this context, the quantum interference phenomenon can be described this way: Suppose that we have a polarization analyzer that allows only one of the two linear photon polarizations to pass through. Then an x or y polarized photon has prob 1 2 of getting through a 45o rotated polarizer, and a 45o polarized photon has prob 1 2 of getting through an x and y analyzer. But an x photon never passes through a y analyzer. If we put a 45o rotated analyzer in between an x and y analyzer, then 1 2 the photons make it through each analyzer. But if we remove the analyzer in the middle no photons make it through the y analyzer. A device can be constructed easily that rotates the linear polarization of a photon, and so applies the transformation Eq. (2.41) to our qubit. As noted, this is not the most general possible unitary transformation. But if we also have a device that alters the relative phase of the two orthogonal linear polarization states |xi ? ei?/2|xi |yi ? e?i?/2|yi , (2.45) the two devices can be employed together to apply an arbitrary 2×2 unitary transformation (of determinant 1) to the photon polarization state.
2.3 The density matrix
2.3.1 The bipartite quantum system
The last lecture was about one qubit. This lecture is about two qubits. (Guess what the next lecture will be about!) Stepping up from one qubit to two is a bigger leap than you might expect. Much that is weird and wonderful about quantum mechanics can be appreciated by considering the properties of the quantum states of two qubits.
14 CHAPTER 2. FOUNDATIONS I: STATES AND ENSEMBLES
The axioms of §2.1 provide a perfectly acceptable general formulation of the quantum theory. Yet under many circumstances, we ?nd that the axioms appear to be violated. The trouble is that our axioms are intended to characterize the quantum behavior of the entire universe. Most of the time, we are not so ambitious as to attempt to understand the physics of the whole universe; we are content to observe just our little corner. In practice, then, the observations we make are always limited to a small part of a much larger quantum system. In the next several lectures, we will see that, when we limit our attention to just part of a larger system, then (contrary to the axioms):
1. States are not rays.
2. Measurements are not orthogonal projections.
3. Evolution is not unitary.
We can best understand these points by considering the simplest possible example: a two-qubit world in which we observe only one of the qubits. So consider a system of two qubits. Qubit A is here in the room with us, and we are free to observe or manipulate it any way we please. But qubit B is locked in a vault where we can’t get access to it. Given some quantum state of the two qubits, we would like to ?nd a compact way to characterize the observations that can be made on qubit A alone. We’ll use {|0iA,|1iA} and {|0iB,|1iB} to denote orthonormal bases forqubits A and B respectively. Consider a quantum state of the two-qubit world of the form
|?iAB = a|0iA ?|0iB + b|1iA ?|1iB. (2.46) In this state, qubits A and B are correlated. Suppose we measure qubit A by projecting onto the {|0iA,|1iA} basis. Then with probability |a|2 we obtain the result |0iA, and the measurement prepares the state |0iA ?|0iB. (2.47) with probability |b|2, we obtain the result |1iA and prepare the state |1iA ?|1iB. (2.48)
2.3. THE DENSITY MATRIX 15
In either case, a de?nite state of qubit B is pickedout by the measurement. If we subsequently measure qubit B, then we are guaranteed (with probability one) to ?nd |0iB if we had found |0iA, and we are guaranteed to ?nd |1iB if we found|1iA. In this sense, the outcomes of the{|0iA,|1iA}and{|0iB,|1iB} measurements are perfectly correlated in the state |?iAB. But now I would like to consider more general observables acting on qubit A, and I would like to characterize the measurement outcomes for A alone (irrespective of the outcomes of any measurements of the inaccessible qubit B). An observable acting on qubit A only can be expressed as
MA ?1B, (2.49) where MA is a self-adjoint operator acting on A, and 1B is the identity operator acting on B. The expectation value of the observable in the state |?i is: h?|MA ?1B|?i = (a?Ah0|? B h0|+ b?Bh1|? B h1|)(MA ?1B) (a|0iA ?|0iB + b|1iA ?|1iB) = |a|2Ah0|MA|0iA +|b|2Ah1|MA|1iA, (2.50) (where we have used the orthogonality of |0iB and |1iB). This expression can be rewritten in the form
hMAi = tr(MA?A), (2.51)
?A = |a|2|0iA Ah0|+|b|2|1iA Ah1|, (2.52) and tr(·) denotes the trace. The operator ?A is called the density operator (or density matrix) for qubit A. It is self-adjoint, positive (its eigenvalues are nonnegative) and it has unit trace (because |?i is a normalized state.) Because hMAi has the form eq. (2.51) for any observable MA acting on qubit A, it is consistent to interpret ?A as representing an ensemble of possible quantum states, each occurring with a speci?ed probability. That is, we would obtain precisely the same result for hMAi if we stipulated that qubit A is in one of two quantum states. With probability p0 = |a|2 it is in the quantum state |0iA, and with probability p1 = |b|2 it is in the state
16 CHAPTER 2. FOUNDATIONS I: STATES AND ENSEMBLES
|1iA. If we are interested in the result of any possible measurement, we can consider MA to be the projection EA(a) onto the relevant eigenspace of a particular observable. Then Prob (a) = p0 Ah0|EA(a)|0iA + p1 Ah1|EA(a)|1iA, (2.53) whichis the probability of outcome a summedover the ensemble,and weighted by the probability of each state in the ensemble. We have emphasized previously that there is an essential di?erence between a coherent superposition of the states|0iA and|1iA, and a probabilistic ensemble, in which |0iA and |1iA can each occur with speci?ed probabilities. For example, for a spin-1 2 object we have seen that if we measure ?1 in the state 1 ?2 (|?zi+|?zi), we will obtain the result | ?xi with probability one. But the ensemble in which | ?zi and | ?zi each occur with probability 1 2 is represented by the density operator
? =
1 2
(|?zih?z |+|?zih?z |)
=
1 2
1, (2.54)
and the projection onto |?xi then has the expectation value tr(|?xih?x |?) = 1 2 . (2.55) In fact, we have seen that any state of one qubit represented by a ray can be interpreted as a spin pointing in some de?nite direction. But because the identity is left unchanged by any unitary change of basis, and the state |?(?,?)i can be obtained by applying a suitable unitary transformation to |?zi, we see that for ? given by eq. (2.54), we have tr(|?(?,?)ih?(?,?)|?) = 1 2 . (2.56) Therefore, if the state |?iAB in eq. (2.57) is prepared, with |a|2 = |b|2 = 1 2, and we measure the spin A along any axis, we obtain a completely random result; spin up or spin down can occur, each with probability 1 2. This discussion of the correlated two-qubit state |?iAB is easily generalized to an arbitrary state of any bipartite quantum system (a system divided into two parts). The Hilbert space of a bipartite system is HA ?HB where
2.3. THE DENSITY MATRIX 17
HA,B are the Hilbert spaces of the two parts. This means that if {|iiA} is an orthonormal basis for HA and {|µiB} is an orthonormal basis for HB, then {|iiA ?|µiB} is an orthonormal basis for HA ?HB. Thus an arbitrary pure state of HA ?HB can be expanded as |?iAB =X i,µ aiµ|iiA ?|µiB, (2.57) wherePi,µ|aiµ|2 = 1. The expectation value of an observable MA?1B, that acts only on subsystem A is hMAi = ABh?|MA ?1B|?iAB =X j,? a? j? (Ahj|? B h?|)(MA ?1B)X i,µ aiµ (|iiA ?|µiB) = X i,j,µ a?jµaiµ Ahj|MA|iiA = tr(MA?A), (2.58)
where
?A = trB (|?iAB ABh?|) ?X i,j,µ aiµa?jµ|iiA Ahj| . (2.59) We say that the density operator ?A for subsystem A is obtained by performing a partial trace over subsystem B of the density matrix (in this case a pure state) for the combined system AB. From the de?nition eq. (2.59), we can immediately infer that ?A has the following properties: 1. ?A is self-adjoint: ?A = ?† A. 2. ?A is positive: For any |?iA Ah?|?A|?iA =Pµ|Pi aiµ Ah?|iiA|2 ? 0. 3. tr(?A) = 1: We have tr ?A =Pi,µ|aiµ|2 = 1, since|?iAB is normalized. It follows that ?A can be diagonalized, that the eigenvalues are all real and nonnegative, and that the eigenvalues sum to one. If we are looking at a subsystem of a larger quantum system, then, even if the state of the larger system is a ray, the state of the subsystem need
18 CHAPTER 2. FOUNDATIONS I: STATES AND ENSEMBLES
not be; in general, the state is represented by a density operator. In the case where the state of the subsystem is a ray, and we say that the state is pure. Otherwise the state is mixed. If the state is a pure state |?iA, then the density matrix ?A = |?iA Ah?|is the projection onto the one-dimensional space spanned by|?iA. Hence a pure density matrix has the property ?2 = ?. A general density matrix, expressed in the basis in which it is diagonal, has the form ?A =X a pa|?aih?a|, (2.60) where 0 < pa ? 1 and Pa pa = 1. If the state is not pure, there are two or more terms in this sum, and ?2 6= ?; in fact, tr ?2 = Pp2 a < Ppa = 1.We say that ? is an incoherent superposition of the states {|?ai}; incoherent meaning that the relative phases of the |?ai are experimentally inaccessible. Since the expectation value of any observable M acting on the subsystem can be expressed as hMi = trM? =X a pah?a|M|?ai, (2.61) we see as before that we may interpret ? as describing an ensemble of pure quantum states, in which the state |?ai occurs with probability pa. We have, therefore, come a long part of the way to understanding how probabilities arise in quantum mechanicswhen a quantum system A interactswith another system B. A and B become entangled, that is, correlated. The entanglement destroys the coherence of a superposition of states of A, so that some of the phases in the superposition become inaccessible if we look at A alone. We may describe this situation by saying that the state of system A collapses — it is in one of a set of alternative states, each of which can be assigned a probability.
2.3.2 Bloch sphere
Let’s return to the case in which system A is a single qubit, and consider the form of the general density matrix. The most general self-adjoint 2×2 matrix has four real parameters, and can be expanded in the basis {1,?1,?2,?3}. Since each ?i is traceless, the coe?cient of 1 in the expansion of a density
2.3. THE DENSITY MATRIX 19
matrix ? must be 1 2 (so that tr(?) = 1), and ? may be expressed as
?(~ P) =
1 21 + ~ P ·~?
?
1 2
(1 + P1?1 + P2?2 + P3?3)
=
1 2 1 + P3 P1 ?iP2 P1 + iP2 1?P3 !. (2.62)
We can compute det? = 1 41? ~ P2. Therefore, a necessary condition for ?to have nonnegative eigenvalues is det ? ? 0 or ~ P2 ? 1. This condition isalso su?cient; since tr ? = 1, it is not possible for ? to have two negative eigenvalues. Thus, there is a 1 ? 1 correspondence between the possible density matrices of a single qubit and the points on the unit 3-ball 0 ?|~ P|? 1. This ball is usually called the Bloch sphere (although of course it is really a ball, not a sphere). The boundary |~ P| = 1 of the ball (which really is a sphere) contains the density matrices with vanishing determinant. Since tr? = 1, these density matrices must have the eigenvalues 0 and 1. They are one-dimensional projectors, and hence pure states. We have already seen that every pure state of a single qubit is of the form |?(?,?)i and can be envisioned as a spin pointing in the (?,?) direction. Indeed using the property
(ˆ n·?~)2 = 1, (2.63)
where ˆ n is a unit vector, we can easily verify that the pure-state density matrix
?(ˆ n) =
1 2
(1 + ˆ n·~?) (2.64)
satis?es the property
(ˆ n·?~)?~(ˆ n) = ?(ˆ n)(ˆ n·?~) = ?(ˆ n), (2.65) and, therefore is the projector
?(ˆ n) = |?(ˆ n)ih?(ˆ n)|; (2.66)
that is, ˆ n is the direction along which the spin is pointing up. Alternatively, from the expression |?(?,?)i = e?i?/2 cos ? 2 ei?/2 sin ? 2 !, (2.67)
20 CHAPTER 2. FOUNDATIONS I: STATES AND ENSEMBLES
we may compute directly that ?(?,?) = |?(?,?)ih?(?,?)| = cos2 ? 2 cos ? 2 sin ? 2e?i? cos ? 2 sin ? 2ei? sin2 ? 2 != 1 2 1 + 1 2 cos? sin?e?i? sin?ei? ?cos? !
=
1 2
(1 + ˆ n·?~) (2.68)
where ˆ n = (sin? cos?,sin? sin?,cos?). One nice property of the Bloch parametrization of the pure states is that while |?(?,?)i has an arbitrary overall phase that has no physical signi?cance, there is no phase ambiguity in the density matrix ?(?,?) = |?(?,?)ih?(?,?)|; all the parameters in ? have a physical meaning. From the property
1 2
tr ?i?j = ?ij (2.69)
we see that
hˆ n·?~i~ P = trˆ n·?~?(~ P)= ˆ n· ~P . (2.70)
Thus the vector ~ P in Eq. (2.62) parametrizes the polarization of the spin. If there are many identicallyprepared systems at our disposal, we can determine ~ P (and hence the complete density matrix ?(~ P)) by measuring hˆ n·?~i alongeach of three linearly independent axes.
2.3.3 Gleason’s theorem
We arrived at the density matrix ? and the expression tr(M?) for the expectation value of an observable M by starting from our axioms of quantum mechanics, and then considering the description of a portion of a larger quantum system. But it is encouraging to know that the density matrix formalism is a very general feature in a much broader framework. This is the content of Gleason’s theorem (1957). Gleason’s theorem starts from the premise that it is the task of quantum theory to assign consistent probabilities to all possible orthogonal projections in a Hilbert space (in other words, to all possible measurements of observables).
2.3. THE DENSITY MATRIX 21
A state of a quantum system, then, is a mapping that take each projection (E2 = E and E = E†) to a nonnegative real number less than one: E? p(E); 0 ? p(E) ?1. (2.71) This mapping must have the properties:
(1) p(0) = 0
(2) p(1) = 1
(3) If E1E2 = 0, then p(E1 + E2) = p(E1) + p(E2).
Here (3) is the crucial assumption. It says that (since projections on to mutually orthogonal spaces can be viewed as mutually exclusive alternatives) the probabilities assigned to mutually orthogonal projections must be additive. This assumption is very powerful, because there are so many di?erent ways to choose E1 and E2. Roughly speaking, the ?rst two assumptions say that whenever we make a measurement; (1) there is always an outcome, and (2) the probabilities of all possible outcomes sum to 1. Under these assumptions, Gleason showed that for any such map, there is a hermitian, positive ? with tr? = 1 such that
p(E) = tr(?E). (2.72)
as long as the dimension of the Hilbert space is greater than 2. Thus, the density matrix formalism is really necessary, if we are to represent observables as self-adjoint operators in Hilbert space, and we are to consistently assign probabilities to all possible measurement outcomes. Crudely speaking, the requirement of additivity of probabilities for mutually exclusive outcomes is so strong that we are inevitably led to the linear expression eq. (2.72). The case of a two-dimensional Hilbert space is special because there just are not enough mutually exclusive projections in two dimensions. All nontrivial projections are of the form
E(ˆ n) =
1 2
(1 + ˆ n·?~), (2.73)
and
E(ˆ n)E(ˆ m) = 0 (2.74)
22 CHAPTER 2. FOUNDATIONS I: STATES AND ENSEMBLES
only for ˆ m = ?ˆ n; therefore, any function f(ˆ n) on the two-sphere such that f(ˆ n) + f(?ˆ n) = 1 satis?es the premises of Gleason’s theorem, and there are many such functions. However, in three-dimensions, there are may more alternative ways to partition unity, so that Gleason’s assumptions are far more powerful. The proof of the theorem will not be given here. See Peres, p. 190 ?, for a discussion.
2.3.4 Evolution of the density operator
So far, we have not discussed the time evolution of mixed states. In the case of a bipartite pure state governed by the usual axioms of quantum theory, let us suppose that the Hamiltonian on HA ?HB has the form HAB = HA ?1B + 1A ?HB. (2.75) Under this assumption, there is no coupling between the two subsystems A and B, so that each evolves independently. The time evolution operator for the combined system UAB(t) = UA(t)?UB(t), (2.76) decomposes into separate unitary time evolution operators acting on each system. Inthe Schr¨odinger picture of dynamics, then, an initialpure state|?(0)iAB of the bipartite system given by eq. (2.57) evolves to |?(t)iAB =X i,µ aiµ|i(t)iA ?|µ(t)iB, (2.77) where |i(t)iA = UA(t)|i(0)iA, |µ(t)iB = UB(t)|µ(0)iB, (2.78) de?ne new orthonormal basis for HA and HB (since UA(t) and UB(t) are unitary). Taking the partial trace as before, we ?nd ?A(t) =X i,j,µ aiµa? j?|i(t)iA Ahj(t)| = UA(t)?A(0)UA(t)†. (2.79)
2.4. SCHMIDT DECOMPOSITION 23
Thus UA(t), acting by conjugation, determines the time evolution of the density matrix. In particular, in the basis in which ?A(0) is diagonal, we have ?A(t) =X a paUA(t)|?a(0)iA Ah?a(0)|UA(t). (2.80) Eq. (2.80) tells us that the evolution of ?A is perfectly consistent with the ensemble interpretation. Each state in the ensemble evolves forward in time governed by UA(t). If the state |?a(0)i occurs with probability pa at time 0, then |?a(t)i occurs with probability pa at the subsequent time t. On the other hand, it should be clear that eq. (2.80) applies only under the assumption that systems A and B are not coupled by the Hamiltonian. Later, we will investigate how the density matrix evolves under more general conditions.
2.4 Schmidt decomposition
A bipartite pure state can be expressed in a standard form (the Schmidt decomposition) that is often very useful. To arrive at this form, note that an arbitrary vector in HA ?HB can be expanded as |?iAB =X i,µ aiµ|iiA|µiB ?X i |iiA|˜ iiB. (2.81) Here {|iiA} and {|µiB} are orthonormal basis for HA and HB respectively, but to obtain the second equality in eq. (2.81) we have de?ned |˜ iiB ?X µ aiµ|µiB. (2.82) Note that the |˜ iiB’s need not be mutually orthogonal or normalized. Now let’s suppose that the {|iiA} basis is chosen to be the basis in which? A is diagonal, ?A =X i pi|iiA Ahi|. (2.83) We can also compute ?A by performing a partial trace, ?A = trB(|?iAB ABh?|)
24 CHAPTER 2. FOUNDATIONS I: STATES AND ENSEMBLES = trB(X ij |iiA Ahj|?|˜ iiB Bh˜ j|) =X ij Bh˜ j|˜ iiB (|iiA Ahj|) . (2.84)
We obtained the last equality in eq. (2.84) by noting that trB|˜ iiB Bh˜ j|=X k Bhk|˜ iiB Bh˜ j|kiB =X k Bh˜ j|kiB Bhk|˜ iiB = Bh˜ j|˜ iiB, (2.85) where {|kiB} is an orthonormal basis for HB. By comparing eq. (2.83) and eq. (2.84), we see that Bh˜ j|˜ iiB = pi?ij. (2.86) Hence, it turns out that the {|˜ iiB} are orthogonal after all. We obtainorthonormal vectors by rescaling, |i0iB = p?1/2 i |iiB (2.87) (we may assume pi 6= 0, because we will need eq. (2.87) only for i appearing in the sum eq. (2.83)), and therefore obtain the expansion |?iAB =X i ?pi|iiA|i0iB, (2.88) in terms of a particular orthonormal basis of HA and HB. Eq. (2.88) is the Schmidt decomposition of the bipartite pure state|?iAB. Any bipartite pure state can be expressed in this form, but of course the bases used depend on the pure state that is being expanded. In general, we can’t simultaneously expand both |?iAB and |?iAB ?HA ?HB in the form eq. (2.88) using the same orthonormal bases for HA and HB. Using eq. (2.88), we can also evaluate the partial trace over HA to obtain ?B = trA (|?iAB ABh?|) =X i pi|i0iB Bhi0|. (2.89) We see that ?A and ?B have the same nonzero eigenvalues. Of course, there is no need for HA and HB to have the same dimension, so the number of zero eigenvalues of ?A and ?B can di?er. If ?A (and hence ?B) have no degenerate eigenvalues other than zero, then the Schmidt decomposition of |?iAB is essentially uniquely determined
2.4. SCHMIDT DECOMPOSITION 25
by ?A and ?B. We can diagonalize ?A and ?B to ?nd the |iiA’s and |i0iB’s, and then we pair up the eigenstates of ?A and ?B with the same eigenvalue to obtain eq. (2.88). We have chosen the phases of our basis states so that no phases appear in the coe?cients in the sum; the only remaining freedom is to rede?ne |iiA and |i0iB by multiplying by opposite phases (which of course leaves the expression eq. (2.88) unchanged). But if ?A has degenerate nonzero eigenvalues, then we need more information than that provided by ?A and ?B to determine the Schmidt decomposition; we need to know which |i0iB gets paired with each |iiA. For example, if both HA and HB are N-dimensional and Uij is any N×N unitary matrix, then
|?iAB =
1 ?N
N X i,j=1|iiAUij|j0iB, (2.90)
will yield ?A = ?B = 1 N 1 when we take partial traces. Furthermore, we are free to apply simultaneous unitary transformations in HA and HB, |?iAB = 1 ?N X i |iiA|i0iB = 1 ?N X ijk U? ij|jiAUik|k0iB; (2.91) this preserves the state |?iAB, but illustrates that there is an ambiguity in the basis used when we express |?iAB in the Schmidt form.
2.4.1 Entanglement With any bipartite pure state |?iAB we may associate a positive integer, the Schmidt number, which is the number of nonzero eigenvalues in ?A (or ?B) and hence the number of terms in the Schmidt decomposition of |?iAB. In terms of this quantity, we can de?ne what it means for a bipartite pure state to be entangled: |?iAB is entangled (or nonseparable) if its Schmidt number is greater than one; otherwise, it is separable (or unentangled). Thus, a separable bipartite pure state is a direct product of pure states in HA and HB, |?iAB =|?iA ?|?iB; (2.92) then the reduced density matrices ?A = |?iA Ah?| and ?B = |?iB Bh?| are pure. Any state that cannot be expressed as such a direct product is entangled; then ?A and ?B are mixed states.
26 CHAPTER 2. FOUNDATIONS I: STATES AND ENSEMBLES
One of our main goals this term will be to understand better the significance of entanglement. It is not strictly correct to say that subsystems A and B are uncorrelated if |?iAB is separable; after all, the two spins in the separable state |?iA|?iB, (2.93) are surely correlated – they are both pointing in the same direction. But the correlations between A and B in an entangled state have a di?erent character than those in a separable state. Perhaps the critical di?erence is that entanglement cannot be created locally. The only way to entangle A and B is for the two subsystems to directly interact with one another. We can prepare the state eq. (2.93) without allowing spins A and B to ever come into contact with one another. We need only send a (classical!) message to two preparers (Alice and Bob) telling both of them to prepare a spin pointing along the z-axis. But the only way to turn the state eq. (2.93) into an entangled state like
1 ?2 (|?iA|?iB +|?iA|?iB), (2.94)
is to apply a collective unitary transformation to the state. Local unitary transformations of the form UA?UB, and local measurements performed by Alice or Bob, cannot increase the Schmidt number of the two-qubit state, no matter how much Alice and Bob discuss what they do. To entangle two qubits, we must bring them together and allow them to interact. As we will discuss later, it is also possible to make the distinction between entangled and separable bipartite mixed states. We will also discuss various ways in which local operations can modify the form of entanglement, and some ways that entanglement can be put to use.
2.5 Ambiguity of the ensemble interpretation
2.5.1 Convexity Recall that an operator ? acting on a Hilbert space H may be interpreted as a density operator if it has the three properties:
(1) ? is self-adjoint.
2.5. AMBIGUITY OF THE ENSEMBLE INTERPRETATION 27
(2) ? is nonnegative.
(3) tr(?) = 1.
It follows immediately that, given two density matrices ?1, and ?2, we can always construct another density matrix as a convex linear combination of the two:
?(?) = ??1 + (1??)?2 (2.95) is a density matrix for any real ? satisfying 0 ? ? ? 1. We easily see that ?(?) satis?es (1) and (3) if ?1 and ?2 do. To check (2), we evaluate
h?|?(?)|?i = ?h?|?1|?i+ (1??)h?|?2|?i? 0; (2.96) h?(?)i is guaranteed to be nonnegative because h?1i and h?2i are. We have, therefore, shown that in a Hilbert space H of dimension N, the density operators are a convex subset of the real vector space of N × N hermitian matrices. (A subset of a vector space is said to be convex if the set contains the straight line segment connecting any two points in the set.) Most density operators can be expressed as a sum of other density operators in many di?erent ways. But the pure states are special in this regard – it is not possible to express a pure state as a convex sum of two other states. Consider a pure state ? = |?ih?|, and let |??i denote a vector orthogonal to |?i,h??|?i = 0. Suppose that ? can be expanded as in eq. (2.95); then h??|?|??i = 0 = ?h??|?1|??i + (1??)h??|?2|??i. (2.97) Since the right hand side is a sum of two nonnegative terms, and the sum vanishes, both terms must vanish. If ? is not 0 or 1, we conclude that ?1 and ?2 are orthogonal to |??i. But since |??i can be any vector orthogonal to |?i, we conclude that ?1 = ?2 = ?. The vectors in a convex set that cannot be expressed as a linear combination of other vectors in the set are called the extremal points of the set. We have just shown that the pure states are extremal points of the set of density matrices. Furthermore, only the pure states are extremal, because any mixed state can be written ? =Pi pi|iihi| in the basis in which it is diagonal, and so is a convex sum of pure states.
28 CHAPTER 2. FOUNDATIONS I: STATES AND ENSEMBLES
We have already encounteredthis structure in our discussion of the special case of the Bloch sphere. We saw that the density operators are a (unit) ball in the three-dimensional set of 2 × 2 hermitian matrices with unit trace. The ball is convex, and its extremal points are the points on the boundary. Similarly, the N ×N density operators are a convex subset of the (N2 ?1)dimensional set of N×N hermitianmatriceswithunit trace, and the extremal points of the set are the pure states. However, the 2×2 case is atypical in one respect: for N > 2, the points on the boundary of the set of density matrices are not necessarily pure states. The boundary of the set consists of all density matrices with at least one vanishing eigenvalue (since there are nearby matrices with negative eigenvalues). Such a density matrix need not be pure, for N > 2, since the number of nonvanishing eigenvalues can exceed one.
2.5.2 Ensemble preparation
The convexity of the set of density matrices has a simple and enlightening physical interpretation. Suppose that a preparer agrees to prepare one of two possible states; with probability ?, the state ?1 is prepared, and with probability 1 ? ?, the state ?2 is prepared. (A random number generator might be employed to guide this choice.) To evaluate the expectation value of any observable M, we average over both the choices of preparation and the outcome of the quantum measurement:
hMi = ?hMi1 + (1??)hMi2 = ?tr(M?1) + (1??)tr(M?2) = tr(M?(?)). (2.98)
All expectation values are thus indistinguishable from what we would obtain if the state ?(?) had been prepared instead. Thus, we have an operational procedure, given methods for preparing the states ?1 and ?2, for preparing any convex combination. Indeed, for any mixed state ?, there are an in?nite variety of ways to express ? as a convex combination of other states, and hence an in?nite variety of procedures we could employ to prepare ?, all of which have exactly the same consequences for any conceivable observation of the system. But a pure state is di?erent; it can be prepared in only one way. (This is what is “pure” about a pure state.) Every pure state is an eigenstate of some
2.5. AMBIGUITY OF THE ENSEMBLE INTERPRETATION 29
observable, e.g., for the state ? = |?ih?|, measurement of the projection E = |?ih?| is guaranteed to have the outcome 1. (For example, recall that every pure state of a single qubit is “spin-up” along some axis.) Since ? is the only state for which the outcome of measuring E is 1 with 100% probability, there is no way to reproduce this observable property by choosing one of several possible preparations. Thus, the preparation of a pure state is unambiguous (we can determine a unique preparation if we have many copies of the state to experiment with), but the preparation of a mixed state is always ambiguous. How ambiguous is it? Since any ? can be expressed as a sum of pure states, let’s con?ne our attention to the question: in how many ways can a density operator be expressed as a convex sum of pure states? Mathematically, this is the question: in how many ways can ? be written as a sum of extremal states? As a ?rst example, consider the “maximally mixed” state of a single qubit:
? =
1 2
1. (2.99)
This can indeed be prepared as an ensemble of pure states in an in?nite variety of ways. For example,
? =
1 2|?zih?z |+
1 2|?zih?z |, (2.100) so we obtain ? if we prepare either |?zi or |?zi, each occurring with probability 1 2. But we also have
? =
1 2|?xih?x |+
1 2|?xih?x |, (2.101) so we obtain ? if we prepare either |?xi or |?xi, each occurring with probability 1 2. Now the preparation procedures are undeniably di?erent. Yet there is no possible way to tell the di?erence by making observations of the spin. More generally, the point at the center of the Bloch ball is the sum of any two antipodal points on the sphere – preparing either|?ˆ ni or |?ˆ ni, eachoccurring with probability 1 2 will generate ? = 1 21. Only in the case where ? has two (or more) degenerate eigenvalues will there be distinct ways of generating ? from an ensemble of mutually orthogonal pure states, but there is no good reason to con?ne our attention to
30 CHAPTER 2. FOUNDATIONS I: STATES AND ENSEMBLES
ensembles of mutually orthogonal pure states. We may consider a point in the interior of the Bloch ball
?(~ P) =
1 2
(1 + ~ P ·~?), (2.102)
with 0 <|~ P| < 1, and it too can be expressed as ?(~ P) = ??(ˆ n1) + (1??)?(ˆ n2), (2.103) if ~ P = ?ˆ n1 + (1? ?)ˆ n2 (or in other words, if ~ P lies somewhere on the line segment connecting the points ˆ n1 and ˆ n2 on the sphere). Evidently, for any ~ P, there is a solution associated with any chord of the sphere that passes through the point ~ P; all such chords comprise a two-parameter family. This highly ambiguous nature of the preparation of a mixed quantum state is one of the characteristic features of quantum information that contrasts sharply with classical probability distributions. Consider, for example, the case of a probability distribution for a single classical bit. The two extremal distributions are those in which either 0 or 1 occurs with 100% probability. Any probability distribution for the bit is a convex sum of these two extremal points. Similarly, if there are N possible states, there are N extremal distributions, and any probability distribution has a unique decomposition into extremal ones (the convex set of probability distributions is a simplex). If 0 occurs with 21% probability, 1 with 33% probability, and 2 with 46% probability, there is a unique preparation procedure that yields this probability distribution!
2.5.3 Faster than light?
Let’s now return to our earlier viewpoint – that a mixed state of system A arises because A is entangled with system B – to further consider the implications of the ambiguous preparation of mixed states. If qubit A has density matrix
?A =
1 2|?ziA Ah?z |+
1 2|?ziA Ah?z |, (2.104) this density matrix could arise from an entangled bipartite pure state |?iAB with the Schmidt decomposition
|?iAB =
1 ?2 (|?ziA|?ziB +|?ziA|?ziB). (2.105)
2.5. AMBIGUITY OF THE ENSEMBLE INTERPRETATION 31
Therefore, the ensemble interpretation of ?A in which either |?ziA or |?ziA is prepared (each with probability p = 1 2) can be realized by performing a measurement of qubit B. We measure qubit B in the {|?ziB,|?ziB} basis; if the result | ?ziB is obtained, we have prepared | ?ziA, and if the result |?7iB is obtained, we have prepared |?ziA. But as we have already noted, in this case, because ?A has degenerate eigenvalues, the Schmidt basis is not unique. We can apply simultaneous unitary transformations to qubits A and B (actually, if we apply U to A we must apply U? to B) without modifying the bipartite pure state |?iAB. Therefore, for any unit 3-vector ˆ n,|?iAB has a Schmidt decomposition of theform
|?iAB =
1 ?2 (|?ˆ niA|?ˆ n0iB +|?ˆ niA|?ˆ n0iB). (2.106)
We see that by measuring qubit B in a suitable basis, we can realize any interpretation of ?A as an ensemble of two pure states. Bright students, upon learning of this property, are sometimes inspired to suggest a mechanism for faster-than-light communication. Many copies of |?iAB are prepared. Alice takes all of the A qubits to the Andromeda galaxy and Bob keeps all of the B qubits on earth. When Bob wants to send a onebit message to Alice, he chooses to measure either ?1 or ?3 for all his spins, thus preparing Alice’s spins in either the {| ?ziA,|?ziA} or {|?xiA,| ?xiA} ensembles.1 To read the message, Alice immediately measures her spins to see which ensemble has been prepared. But exceptionally bright students (or students who heard the previous lecture) can see the ?aw in this scheme. Though the two preparation methods are surely di?erent, both ensembles are described by precisely the same density matrix ?A. Thus, there is no conceivable measurement Alice can make that will distinguish the two ensembles, and no way for Alice to tell what action Bob performed. The “message” is unreadable. Why, then, do we con?dently state that “the two preparation methods are surely di?erent?” To qualm any doubts about that, imagine that Bob either (1) measures all of his spins along the ˆ z-axis, or (2) measures all of his spins along the ˆ x-axis, and then calls Alice on the intergalactic telephone. He does not tell Alice whether he did (1) or (2), but he does tell her the results of all his measurements: “the ?rst spin was up, the second was down,” etc. Now
1U is real in this case, so U = U ? and ˆ n = ˆ n0.
32 CHAPTER 2. FOUNDATIONS I: STATES AND ENSEMBLES
Alice performs either (1) or (2) on her spins. If both Alice and Bob measured along the same axis, Alice will ?nd that every single one of her measurement outcomes agrees with what Bob found. But if Alice and Bob measured along di?erent (orthogonal) axes, then Alice will ?nd no correlation between her results and Bob’s. About half of her measurements agree with Bob’s and about half disagree. If Bob promises to do either (1) or (2), and assuming no preparation or measurement errors, then Alice will know that Bob’s action was di?erent than hers (even though Bob never told her this information) as soon as one of her measurements disagrees with what Bob found. If all their measurements agree, then if many spins are measured, Alice will have very high statistical con?dence that she and Bob measured along the same axis. (Even with occasional measurement errors, the statistical test will still be highly reliable if the error rate is low enough.) So Alice does have a way to distinguish Bob’s two preparation methods, but in this case there is certainly no faster-than-light communication, because Alice had to receive Bob’s phone call before she could perform her test.
2.5.4 Quantum erasure We had said that the density matrix ?A = 1 21 describes a spin in an incoherent superposition of the pure states | ?ziA and | ?ziA. This was to be distinguished from coherent superpositions of these states, such as
|?x,?xi =
1 2
(|?zi±|?zi) ; (2.107) in the case of a coherent superposition, the relative phase of the two states has observable consequences (distinguishes|?xifrom|?xi). In the case of an incoherent superposition, the relative phase is completely unobservable. The superposition becomes incoherent if spin A becomes entangled with another spin B, and spin B is inaccessible. Heuristically, the states |?ziA and |?ziA can interfere (the relative phase of these states can be observed) only if we have no information about whether the spin state is | ?ziA or | ?ziA. More than that, interference can occur only if there is in principle no possible way to ?nd out whether the spin is up or down along the z-axis. Entangling spin A with spin B destroys interference, (causes spin A to decohere) because it is possible in principle for us to determine if spin A is up or down along ˆ z by performing a suitable measurement of spin B.
2.5. AMBIGUITY OF THE ENSEMBLE INTERPRETATION 33
But we have now seen that the statement that entanglement causes decoherence requires a quali?cation. Suppose that Bob measures spin B along the ˆ x-axis, obtaining either the result |?xiB or |?xiB, and that he sends his measurement result to Alice. Now Alice’s spin is a pure state (either |?xiA or |?xiA) and in fact a coherent superposition of |?ziA and |?ziA. We have managed to recover the purity of Alice’s spin before the jaws of decoherence could close! Suppose that Bob allows his spin to pass through a Stern–Gerlach apparatus oriented along the ˆ z-axis. Well, of course, Alice’s spin can’t behave like a coherent superposition of |?ziA and |?ziA; all Bob has to do is look to see which way his spin moved, and he will know whether Alice’s spin is up or down along ˆ z. But suppose that Bob does not look. Instead, he carefully refocuses the two beams without maintaining any record of whether his spin moved up or down, and then allows the spin to pass through a second Stern–Gerlach apparatus oriented along the ˆ x-axis. This time he looks, and communicates the result of his ?1 measurement to Alice. Now the coherence of Alice’s spin has been restored! This situation has been called a quantum eraser. Entangling the two spins creates a “measurement situation” in which the coherence of |?ziA and | ?ziA is lost because we can ?nd out if spin A is up or down along ˆ z by observing spin B. But when we measure spin B along ˆ x, this information is “erased.” Whether the result is |?xiB or |?xiB does not tell us anything about whether spin A is up or down along ˆ z, because Bob has been careful not to retain the “which way” information that he might have acquired by looking at the ?rst Stern–Gerlach apparatus.2 Therefore, it is possible again for spin A to behave like a coherent superposition of |?ziA and |?ziA (and it does, after Alice hears about Bob’s result). We can best understand the quantum eraser from the ensemble viewpoint. Alice has many spins selected from an ensemble described by ?A = 1 21, and there is no way for her to observe interference between | ?ziA and | ?ziA. When Bob makes his measurement along ˆ x, a particular preparation of the ensemble is realized. However, this has no e?ect that Alice can perceive – her spin is still described by ?A = 1 21 as before. But, when Alice receives Bob’s phone call, she can select a subensemble of her spins that are all in the pure state |?xiA. The information that Bob sends allows Alice to distill
2One often says that the “welcher weg” information has been erased, because it sounds more sophisticated in German.
34 CHAPTER 2. FOUNDATIONS I: STATES AND ENSEMBLES
purity from a maximally mixed state. Another wrinkle on the quantum eraser is sometimescalled delayed choice. This just means that the situation we have describedis really completelysymmetric between Alice and Bob, so it can’t make any di?erence who measures ?rst. (Indeed, if Alice’s and Bob’s measurements are spacelike separated events, there is no invariant meaning to which came ?rst; it depends on the frame of reference of the observer.) Alice could measure all of her spins today (say along ˆ x) before Bob has made his mind up how he will measure his spins. Next week, Bob can decide to “prepare” Alice’s spins in the states | ?ˆ niA and | ?ˆ niA (that is the “delayed choice”). He then tells Alice which were the | ?ˆ niA spins, and she can check her measurement record to verifythat
h?1iˆ n = ˆ n· ˆx . (2.108)
The results are the same, irrespective of whether Bob “prepares” the spins before or after Alice measures them. We have claimed that the density matrix ?A provides a complete physical description of the state of subsystem A, because it characterizes all possible measurements that can be performed on A. One sometimes hears the objection3 that the quantum eraser phenomenon demonstrates otherwise. Since the information received from Bob enables Alice to recover a pure state from the mixture, how can we hold that everything Alice can know about A is encoded in ?A? I don’t think this is the right conclusion. Rather, I would say that quantum erasure provides yet another opportunity to recite our mantra: “Information is physical.” The state ?A of system A is not the same thing as ?A accompanied by the information that Alice has received from Bob. This information (which attaches labels to the subensembles) changes the physical description. One way to say this mathematically is that we should include Alice’s “state of knowledge” in our description. An ensemble of spins for which Alice has no information about whether each spin is up or down is a di?erent physical state than an ensemble in which Alice knows which spins are up and which are down.4
3For example, from Roger Penrose in Shadows of the Mind. 4This “state of knowledge” need not really be the state of a human mind; any (inanimate) record that labels the subensemble will su?ce.
2.5. AMBIGUITY OF THE ENSEMBLE INTERPRETATION 35
2.5.5 The GHJW theorem
So far, we have considered the quantum eraser only in the context of a single qubit, described by an ensemble of equally probable mutually orthogonal states, (i.e., ?A = 1 21). The discussion can be considerably generalized. We have already seen that a mixed state of any quantum system can be realized as an ensemble of pure states in an in?nite number of di?erent ways. For a density matrix ?A, consider one such realization: ?A =X i pi|?iiA Ah?i|, Xpi = 1. (2.109) Here the states {|?iiA} are all normalized vectors, but we do not assume that they are mutually orthogonal. Nevertheless, ?A can be realized as an ensemble, in which each pure state |?iiA Ah?i| occurs with probability pi. Of course, for any such ?A, we can construct a “puri?cation” of ?A, a bipartite pure state |?1iAB that yields ?A when we perform a partial trace over HB. One such puri?cation is of the form |?1iAB =X i ?pi|?iiA|?iiB, (2.110) where the vectors |?iiB ?HB are mutually orthogonal and normalized, Bh?i|?jiB = ?ij. (2.111) Clearly, then, trB (|?1iAB ABh?1|) = ?A. (2.112) Furthermore, we can imagine performing an orthogonal measurement in system B that projects onto the|?iiB basis.5 The outcome|?iiB will occur with probability pi, and will prepare the pure state|?iiA Ah?i|of system A. Thus, given the puri?cation |?iAB of ?A, there is a measurement we can perform in system B that realizes the |?iiA ensemble interpretation of ?A. When the measurement outcome in B is known, we have successfully extracted one of the pure states |?iiA from the mixture ?A. What we have just described is a generalization of preparing | ?ziA by measuring spin B along ˆ z (in our discussion of two entangled qubits). But 5The |?iiB’s might not span HB, but in the state |?iAB, measurement outcomes orthogonal to all the |?iiB’s never occur.
36 CHAPTER 2. FOUNDATIONS I: STATES AND ENSEMBLES
to generalize the notion of a quantum eraser, we wish to see that in the state |?1iAB, we can realize a di?erent ensembleinterpretation of ?A by performing a di?erent measurement of B. So let ?A =X µ qµ|?µiA Ah?µ|, (2.113) be another realization of the same density matrix ?A as an ensemble of pure states. For this ensemble as well, there is a corresponding puri?cation |?2iAB =X µ ?qµ|?µiA ?|?µiB, (2.114) where again the {|?µiB’s} are orthonormal vectors in HB. So in the state |?2iAB, we can realize the ensemble by performing a measurement in HB that projects onto the {|?µiB} basis. Now, how are |?1iAB and |?2iAB related? In fact, we can easily showthat |?1iAB = (1A ?UB)|?2iAB; (2.115) the two states di?er by a unitary change of basis acting in HB alone, or |?1iAB =X µ ?qµ|?µiA|?µiB, (2.116) where |?µiB = UB|?µiB, (2.117) is yet another orthonormal basis for HB. We see, then, that there is a single puri?cation|?1iAB of ?A, such that we can realize either the{|?iiA}ensemble or {|?µiA} ensemble by choosing to measure the appropriate observable in system B! Similarly, we may consider many ensembles that all realize ?A, where the maximum number of pure states appearing in any of the ensembles is n. Then we may choose a Hilbert space HB of dimension n, and a pure state |?iAB ?HA ?HB, such that any one of the ensembles can be realized by measuring a suitable observable of B. This is the GHJW 6 theorem. It expresses the quantum eraser phenomenon in its most general form.

2.6. SUMMARY 37
In fact, the GHJW theorem is an almost trivial corollary to the Schmidt decomposition. Both |?1iAB and |?2iAB have a Schmidt decomposition, and because both yield the same ?A when we take the partial trace over B, these decompositions must have the form |?1iAB =X k q?k|kiA|k0 1iB, |?2iAB =X k q?k|kiA|k0 2iB, (2.118) where the ?k’s are the eigenvalues of ?A and the |kiA’s are the corresponding eigenvectors. But since {|k0 1iB} and {|k0 2iB} are both orthonormal bases for HB, there is a unitary UB such that |k0 1iB = UB|k0 2iB, (2.119) from which eq. (2.115) immediately follows. In the ensemble of pure states described by Eq. (2.109), we would say that the pure states |?iiA are superposed incoherently — an observer in system A cannot detect the relative phases of these states. Heuristically, the reason that these states cannot interfere is that it is possible in principle to ?nd out which representative of the ensemble is actually realized by performing a measurement in system B, a projection onto the orthonormal basis {|?iiB}. However, by projecting onto the {|?µiB} basis instead, and relaying the information about the measurement outcome to system A, we can extract one of the pure states |?µiA from the ensemble, even though this state may be a coherent superposition of the |?iiA’s. In e?ect, measuring B in the {|?µiB} basis “erases” the “welcher weg” information (whether the state of A is |?iiA or |?jiA). In this sense, the GHJW theorem characterizes the general quantum eraser. The moral, once again, is that information is physical — the information acquired by measuring system B, when relayed to A, changes the physical description of a state of A.
2.6 Summary Axioms. The arena of quantum mechanics is a Hilbert space H. The fundamental assumptions are: (1) A state is a ray in H.
38 CHAPTER 2. FOUNDATIONS I: STATES AND ENSEMBLES
(2) An observable is a self-adjoint operator on H. (3) A measurement is an orthogonal projection.
(4) Time evolution is unitary.
Density operator. But if we con?ne our attention to only a portion of a larger quantum system, assumptions (1)-(4) need not be satis?ed. In particular, a quantum state is described not by a ray, but by a density operator ?, a nonnegative operator with unit trace. The density operator is pure (and the state can be described by a ray) if ?2 = ?; otherwise, the state is mixed. An observable M has expectation value tr(M?) in this state. Qubit. A quantum system with a two-dimensional Hilbert space is called a qubit. The general density matrix of a qubit is
?(~ P) =
1 2
(1 + ~ P ·?~) (2.120)
where ~ P is a three-component vector of length |~ P| ? 1. Pure states have |~ P| = 1. Schmidt decomposition. For any quantum system divided into two parts A and B (a bipartite system), the Hilbert space is a tensor productHA? HB. For any pure state |?iAB of a bipartite system, there are orthonormal bases {|iiA} for HA and {|i0iB} for HB such that |?iAB =X i ?pi|iiA|i0iB; (2.121) Eq. (2.121) is called the Schmidt decomposition of |?iAB. In a bipartite pure state, subsystems A and B separately are described by density operators ?A and ?B; it follows from eq. (2.121) that ?A and ?B have the same nonvanishing eigenvalues (the pi’s). The number of nonvanishing eigenvalues is called the Schmidt number of |?iAB. A bipartite pure state is said to be entangled if its Schmidt number is greater than one. Ensembles. The density operators on a Hilbert space form a convex set, and the pure states are the extremal points of the set. A mixed state of a system A can be prepared as an ensemble of pure states in many di?erent ways, all of which are experimentally indistinguishable if we observe system A alone. Given any mixed state ?A of system A, any preparation of ?A as an ensemble of pure states can be realized in principle by performing a
2.7. EXERCISES 39
measurement in another system B with which A is entangled. In fact given many such preparations of ?A, there is a single entangled state of A and B such that any one of these preparations can be realized by measuring a suitable observable in B (the GHJW theorem). By measuring in system B and reporting the measurement outcome to system A, we can extract from the mixture a pure state chosen from one of the ensembles.
2.7 Exercises
2.1 Fidelity of a random guess A single qubit (spin-1 2 object) is in an unknown pure state |?i, selectedat random from an ensembleuniformly distributedover the Bloch sphere. We guess at random that the state is|?i. On the average, what is the ?delity F of our guess, de?ned by F ?|h?|?i|2 . (2.122) 2.2 Fidelity after measurement After randomly selecting a one-qubit pure state as in the previous problem, we perform a measurement of the spin along the ˆ z-axis. This measurement prepares a state described by the density matrix ? = P?h?|P?|?i+ P?h?|P?|?i (2.123) (where P?,? denote the projections onto the spin-up and spin-down states along the ˆ z-axis). On the average, with what ?delity F ?h?|?|?i (2.124) does this density matrix represent the initial state |?i? (The improvement in F compared to the answer to the previous problem is a crude measure of how much we learned by making the measurement.)
